# odin-rock-paper-scissors
The rock, paper, scissors project in the JavaScript Basics section of The Odin Project.

Old Code is contained in the commented sections of main.js.

No commits were made of this old code as it simply didnt work. I finished this after the second commit of the unit-converter which taught me a lot on how I could improve this project.
